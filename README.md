#Student Record Management System (Java CLI Project)

This is a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based **Student Record Management System** built using **Core Java**. It allows users to **Add**, **View**, **Update**, and **Delete** student records stored in memory using an `ArrayList`.

---

#Project Description

This mini project simulates a basic student management application for educational or practice purposes. It demonstrates the use of:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java,
- Dynamic data structures like `ArrayList`,
- User interaction via `Scanner`,
- CRUD operations using loop structures and conditional logic.

The application runs in the terminal, providing a menu-based interface for users to interact with student records.
